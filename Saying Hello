Hi there, this is **Michael** from Hong Kong. I'm just starting the coursera course for Data science and reviewed your assignment.
Thought I'd connect with my classmate and share knowledge. I'm a real beginner to programming though.

This is also to try forking someone else' repo and create a pull request. 
I realized I could just "Create new file" on your GitHub repo, and it'll create a fork for me automatically before sending over a pull request.

Anyway... nice to meet you fruitbat666
